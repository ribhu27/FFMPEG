# FFMPEG_audiovideomerge

Audio video merge refers to the process of combining or joining an audio file and a video file together to create a single file that contains both the audio and video components.

In simple terms, imagine you have a video of yourself dancing but you want to add your favorite song as the background music. With the help of a tool called FFmpeg, you can merge the video of you dancing and the audio of your favorite song into one file. This way, when you play the merged file, you will see the video of yourself dancing while the song plays in the background.FFmpeg is a tool that can do this, as well as many other things like compressing, trimming, rotating, and adding filters to videos.
